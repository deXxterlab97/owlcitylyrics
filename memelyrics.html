<br><br><br>
<b>OF JUNE EP (2007)</b><br><br>
<a name="swimming"></a>
<b>1. Swimming in Miami<br></b>

I'm alone above the atmosphere<br>

And no one looking up can find me here<br>

Cause I can close my eyes and disappear<br>

When I climb the stairs to watch the sun<br>

Above the station walls, the colors run<br>

To fill the swimming pool when I am done<br><br>

I am the captain of an oil tanker<br>

That travels through your veins<br><br>

When the satellites hang all around<br>

And I can finally hear the lovely sound<br>

When all the engines in the backroom die down<br><br>

All the airships move across the sky<br>

And my equipment just keeps standing by<br>

The planets glow and intensify<br><br>

I am the pilot of a cargo airplane<br>

That travels through your veins<br><br>

When you are lying half asleep in your room<br>

Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon<br>

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell<br>

It could be raining but then you can never tell<br><br>

If you're alone in this awful downpour<br>

Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door<br><br>

In the evening light the boulevard<br>

Conceals the night with disregard<br>

For all the workers in a west coast ship yard<br><br>

When I rearrange the silverware<br>

And re-install the lights and captain's chair<br>

I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air<br><br>

I am the engineer of forty freight trains<br>

That travels through your veins<br><br>

When you are lying half asleep in your room<br>

Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon<br><br>

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell<br> 

It could be raining but then you can never tell.<br><br>

If you're awake in this awful downpour<br>

Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door<br>

When you are swimming in Miami at night<br>

And all around you are the traffic and city lights.<br><br><br>


<a name="captain"></a>
<b>2. Captain and Cruise Ships<br><br></b>

I am stuck in L.A through the week, and can't get away<br>

And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday<br><br>

Stormy nights re-awake the stomachache that I've acquired<br>

From feeling down, things look grim and I'm so sick, of being tired<br>

Apartment lights go dark, and its depressing but what can I do?<br>

Midnight streets feel dead, when I am so used to driving with you<br><br>

Brighter lights fill the nights and bluer skies reflect in your eyes<br>

As I inspect and analyze all these dreams I don't recognize<br>
If you're still up when the ships in the port, prepare to set sail <br>

Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail<br><br>

Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do? <br>

These empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you<br><br>

Count the stars, watch the waves, absorb the summer sun and think of me<br>

When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea<br>

Can you still hear my voice when I'm outside from over the phone?<br>

For what it's worth darling dear, I wish you were here cause I feel alone<br><br>

When you were home, we'd sing but since you've left I don't hear anything <br>

And though I feel so sad I can't believe things are really that bad<br><br>

Old captains and brand new cruise ships<br>

Sailing over the briny sea<br>

When I crash my beloved desk job<br>

And swim through the debris<br><br>

I'll cut loose and leave this madhouse<br>

Bound for the Atlantic blue<br>

I'll stroll down your tree-lined driveway<br>

And sail the ocean with you<br>
 <br><br>
<a name="designer"></a>
<b>3. Designer Skyline<br><br></b>

Affection, the gifted architect<br>

Is making a draft and beautiful design<br>

The options and possibilities<br>

Are endless when we connect and realign<br><br>

Collections of books and documents<br>

Arise and parade around my cluttered desk<br> 

Reworking the math and measurements<br>

Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque <br>

Like mountains in the Midwest<br><br>

Reaction creates the columns dark<br>

And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale <br>

The structures begin to take their shape <br>

Before I've designed the public monorail<br><br>

The turnpike and high speed motorway<br>

Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets <br>

The airport, the broad suspension bridge<br>

The lake and the beach where several rivers meet <br>

Compounded from the spreadsheet.<br><br>
	

A city sparkles in the night<br>
How can it glow so bright?<br>
The neighborhoods surround the soft florescent light<br>
Designer skyline in my head<br>
Abstract and still well-read<br>
You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead
	
<br><br><br>

<a name="panda"></a>
<b>4. Panda Bear<br><br></b>

I'm moving to Tokyo<br>

Cause I'm tired of San Francisco<br>

My contracts are finally void<br>

And I am getting out<br>

On houses and building tops<br>

I swallow the beams and sun drops<br>

If my echoes could reach your ears<br>

Then I could save my calls<br>

What happens when I'm above<br>

The east river when you are in love<br>

We're staring at all these lights<br>

And I am going blind<br><br>

Fill all of the navy yards<br>

With hard working security guards<br>

Cause the numbers are wearing off<br>

My plastic access cards<br>

How can I begin to say<br>

I feel better off when we stay<br>

In Paris on winter nights<br>

Beneath the snowy veil<br>

Content like a panda bear<br>

Still breathing the fresh mountain air<br>

I'll put on a diving tank<br>

And sing when I inhale<br><br><br>

<a name="airway"></a>
<b>5. The Airway<br><br></b>

When I am fast asleep, I dream<br>

And see you floating high above me<br>

And I awake at dawn<br>

Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn<br><br>

From on the bedroom floor<br>

I watch you sailing far above the seashore<br>

In deep Atlantic skies<br>

You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise<br><br>

Above the avenue<br>

I search among the clouds, trying to see you<br>

But you are just a blur<br>

In the sky when you parachute over the harbor<br><br>

I can see you above with the ocean around me<br>

If I could only stay overhead in the airway<br>

You sail through endless sky<br>

With the evening around you<br>

When I'm out on the bay, you're aloft in the airway<br><br>

When I'm alone at night<br>

I dream you paint the stars against the twilight<br> 

Suspended in the air<br>

I wish your silhouette would always stay there<br><br>

When I am on the beach<br>

I watch you held aloft way out of my reach<br>

But I cannot take flight<br>

Or float upon the air the way that you might<br><br>

When I am in the sea<br>

You gaze down from the sky, trying to see me <br>

But I am just a blur<br>

Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor<br><br>

The airway<br>

You and I in the airway<br>

Aloft in the airway<br>

In love on the airway<br><br><br>

<a name="fuzzy"></a>
<b>6. Fuzzy Blue Light<br><br></b>

If I could look across the country<br>

From California to New Jersey<br>

Then I would count the parks and lake resorts<br> 

And number all the jets and airports<br><br>

All those rather dreary rain clouds<br>

Still bother me<br>

Cause I look through the camera eyepiece<br>

And cannot see<br><br>

If I could open up my window<br>

And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau<br>

Then I would survey all those open miles<br>

And line them up in single file<br><br>

Everywhere I look<br>

I see green scenic sublime<br>

And all those oceanic vistas<br>

Are so divine<br><br>

If I was standing on the balcony<br>

And you were walking down below<br>

I'd feel rather depressed and out of place<br>

And lonely just to watch you go<br><br>

If you were swinging from the highway overpass<br>

Within the western hemisphere<br>

I'd feel rather afraid and insincere<br>

If you began to disappear<br><br>

If I was walking through a sad art gallery<br>

And you were driving through the night<br>

I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease<br>

Beneath the brilliant showroom light<br>
 <br>

If I was flying on a plane above your town<br>

And you were gazing at the sky<br>

Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured<br>

If you began to wave goodbye<br><br><br>

<a name="seattle"></a>
<b>7. Hello Seattle<br><br></b>

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer<br>

In the hills and highlands<br>

I fall asleep in hospital parking lots<br>

And awake in your mouth<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray<br>

Deep beneath the blue waves<br>

I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound<br>

And construct a summer home<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon<br>

Shining down on your face<br>

I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill<br>

And descend inside of you<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse<br>

Feeling warm in your sand<br>

I sing about the tide and the ocean surf<br>

Rolling in the evening breeze<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am an albatross<br>

On the docks and moored boats<br>

I sail above your inlets and interstates<br>

Through the rain and open wind<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse<br>

Throwing beams of bright lights<br>

Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun <br>

Taking heed from everyone<br><br>

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer<br>

In the hills and highlands<br>

I fall asleep in hospital parking lots<br><br>

Take me above your light<br>

Carry me through the night<br>

Hold me secure in flight<br>

Sing me to sleep tonight<br>

Take me above your light<br>

Carry me through the night<br>

Hold me secure in flight<br>

Sing me to sleep tonight<br>
 <br><br>

<b>MAYBE I'M DREAMING (2008)<br><br></b>
<a name="wing"></a>
<b>1. On the Wing (with Breanne Duren)<br><br></b>


Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky<br>

And we'll stir the stars around<br>

And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay<br>

And plummet out of sight and sound<br>

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills <br>

Where I live in the alpine heights<br>

Below the Northern Lights, I spent my coldest nights <br>

Alone, awake and thinking of the weekend we were in love<br><br>

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull <br>

A thousand miles from the tide<br>

Put photos on the walls of New York shopping malls <br>

Distract me so I stay inside<br><br>

I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade <br>

Cause I would make a hook and eye<br>

And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I<br>

We're hanging on so take us high to sing the world goodbye<br><br>

I am floating away<br>

Lost in a silent ballet<br>

I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you<br>

Awake to take in the view<br><br>

Late nights and early parades<br>

Still photos and noisy arcades<br>

My darling, we're both on the wing<br>

Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere<br>

Are you there?<br>

Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?<br>

Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?<br><br>

I am floating away (floating away)<br>

Lost in a silent ballet (silent ballet)<br>

I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you <br>

Awake to take in the view<br><br>

Late nights and early parades (early parades)<br>

Still photos and noisy arcades (noisy arcades)<br>

My darling, we're both on the wing<br>

Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere<br>

Are you there?<br>

Are you there?<br><br><br>
<a name="rainbow"></a>
<b>2. Rainbow Veins<br><br></b>

High rise, veins of the avenue<br>

Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue<br>

Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you <br>

Street lights glisten on the boulevard<br>

And cold nights make staying alert so hard<br>

For heaven's sake, keep me awake<br>

So I won't be caught off guard<br>

Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay <br>

Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?<br><br>

Small town hearts of the New Year<br>

Brought down by gravity, crystal clear<br>

City fog and brave dialog converge on the frontier<br><br>

Make haste, I feel your heartbeat<br>

With new taste for speed, out on the street<br>

Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet<br>

The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow<br>

The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know<br><br>

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains <br>

And I'll blend up that rainbow<br>

Above you and shoot it through your veins<br><br>

Cause your heart has a lack of color<br>

And we should've known<br>

That we'd grow up sooner or later<br>

Cause we wasted all our free time alone<br><br>

Your nerves gather with the altitude<br>

Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued<br><br>

Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood<br> 

Wide eyed, panic on the getaway<br>

The high tide could take me so far away <br>

VCR's and motorcars unite on the seventh day<br>

A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new postmodern age <br>

Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align<br><br>

We were the crashing whitecaps on the ocean<br>

And what lovely seaside holiday away<br>

A palm tree in Christmas lights, my emotion<br>

Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone<br>

As we spent the day alone.<br><br><br>

<a name="super"></a>
<b>3. Super Honeymoon<br><br></b>

Glamour and fashion<br>

Models and magazines<br>

A striking runway entrance<br><br>

Beauty and passion<br>

Stardust and high class scenes<br>

Of popular teens<br><br>

When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire<br>

With ribbons in her blond hair<br><br>

I still remember<br>

She was like a princess<br>

Straight from a dreamy castle<br>

In the air<br><br>

So lovely<br>

She was everything to me<br><br>

Both alone in the dark<br>

We long to see the sun<br>

Rise over the Bering Strait<br><br>

I was sick of the west<br>

When I turned 21<br>

So I moved to the Sunshine State<br><br>

We played golf on the moon<br>

And tennis on the sun<br>

Like athletes of the afternoon<br><br>

The solar flares burned my arms<br>

And made her makeup run<br>

On our super lunar honeymoon<br><br>

I was the youngest son of a congressman<br>

And everything was my fault<br>

She was a gymnast, happily swinging<br>

On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault<br><br><br>

	<b>4. The Saltwater Room (Maybe I'm Dreaming)<br></b> <b>(with Breanne Duren)</b><br><br>

I opened my eyes last night<br>

And saw you in the low light<br>

Walking down by the bay, on the shore,<br>

Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore<br><br>

I was feeling the night grow old<br>

And you were looking so cold<br>

Like an introvert,<br>

I drew my over shirt<br>

Around my arms and began to shiver violently before<br><br>

You happened to look and see<br>

The tunnels all around me<br>

Running into the dark underground<br>

All the subways around create a great sound<br><br>

To my motion fatigue farewell,<br>

With your ear to a seashell<br>

You can hear the waves<br>

In underwater caves<br>

As if you actually were inside a saltwater room<br><br>

Time together is just never quite enough<br>

When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home<br>

What will it take to make or break this hint of love?<br>

We need time, only time<br><br>

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?<br>

If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?<br>

So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?<br>

All the time, all the time<br><br>

Can you believe that the crew has gone<br>

And wouldn't let me sign on?<br>

All my islands have sunk in the deep,<br>

So I can hardly relax or even oversleep<br>
 <br>

I feel as if I were home some nights,<br>

When we count all the ship lights.<br>

I guess I'll never know<br>

Why sparrows love the snow<br>

We'll turn off all of the lights<br>

And set this ballroom aglow<br><br>

So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?<br>

Good evening shuttle bus<br>

Tell me where you're gonna take us<br>

Someplace that I have never been<br>

It's chic transportation to<br>

New destination where<br>

I leave my reflection on the glass<br><br>

I'd ask but we all know<br>

How far these interstates go<br>

Or how deep the city routes go down<br>

In chilly sub depth railways<br>

The weathered concrete stairways<br>

Provide me with the means of getting home<br>

If I ever leave<br><br>

On crystal sand we sleep hand in hand while soothing words<br>
 <br>

So many sights to see<br>

So wake up like an early birdie<br>

And we'll get a head start on the day<br>

Oh, stained glass sky ways<br>

And crowded six lane highways<br>

If I look back when I begin to leave<br>

Will they remember me?<br><br>

Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent<br>

And tour guides make happy brides through heaven soon<br><br>

The bird is here and we are off<br>

To wherever those wings take us<br>

The atmosphere is crawling with airlines<br>

That wind through the clouds<br>

And look down at the crowds<br><br>

Relax your back and let the noise<br>

Sing you to sleep in my arms<br>

If you awake before we arrive<br>

I will carry you down and I won't make a sound<br><br>

The scent is strong as we move on<br>

And breathe in the pristine crime scene<br>

The false veneer is old like a substitute volunteer <br>

From oh some other year<br>
 <br>

I'm just a shell as far as I can tell<br>

So I paint my eyes a light green<br><br>

The silver beams are twirling and swirling<br>

Throughout your dreams<br>

<b>7. The Technicolor Phase<br><br></b>

I am the red in the rose<br>

The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor<br> 

And I am the gray in the ghost<br>

That hides with your clothes behind your closet door.<br><br>

I am the green in the grass<br>

That bends back from underneath your feet<br>

And I am the blue in your back alley view<br>

Where the horizon and the rooftops meet.<br><br>

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed <br>

The colors of the evening stars.<br>

You can go anywhere you wish<br>

Cause I'll be there, wherever you are<br>

Wherever you are, wherever you are<br><br>

I will always be your keys<br>

When we are lost in the technicolor phase<br><br>

I am the black in the book<br>

The letters on the pages that you memorize<br>

And I am the orange in the overcast<br>

Of color that you visualize.<br><br>

I am the white in the walls that soak up<br>

All the sound when you cannot sleep.<br>

And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach <br>

That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.<br><br>

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed <br>

The colors of the evening stars<br> (My darling)<br>

You can go anywhere you wish<br>

Cause I'll be there, wherever you are<br>

Wherever you are<br>

With your eyes are locked on mine<br><br>



Oh, we'll fill the metro skies with country air<br>

And when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you there <br>

I'll meet you there<br><br>

Deep inside of you there's a ruby glow<br>

And it gets brighter then you and I will ever know<br>

There's a rushing sound that surrounds us <br>

When we walk alone <br>

And it's everything we've never known<br><br>

Wander down the street<br>

And I would be the pavement beneath your feet<br><br>

If we could just be immobile for some time<br>

And finally figure out the way we feel<br>

About the missing puzzle pieces <br>

And cloudy question marks <br>

It still looks a bit surreal<br><br>

Oh, I tend to disappear here and there<br>

So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere<br>

And cut out a door in my new living room floor <br>

The porch light is so bright<br>

That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape <br>

Of the rusty fire escape<br>

Cause I knew I'd never see the ground<br>

Unless I was aboard a jet plane<br>

And we were going down<br>

And I woke up beside the ocean<br>

Aloha, my happy west coast friends<br>

Do you feel alive<br>

And wash all around you<br>

Are quite well known by the evening tide<br>

And we can sleep where we reside<br>

Cause I'm history<br>

When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone <br>

Cause I've been dying to leave<br><br>

Yeah, I'll ride the range and hide<br>

All my loose change in my bedroom<br>

Cause riding a dirt bike down<br>

A turnpike always takes its toll on me<br><br>

I've had just about enough of quote<br>

"Diamonds in the rough"<br>

Because my backbone is paper thin<br>

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in<br><br>

If the bombs go off, the sun will still be shining<br> 

Because we've heard it said that<br>

"Every mushroom cloud has a silver lining"<br>

Though I'm always undermining too deep to know<br><br>

Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop<br>

Cause the road tastes like wintergreen<br>

The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane<br> 

Mixed with stale gasoline<br><br>

I'll soak up the sound, try to sleep on the wet ground <br>

I'll get ten minutes give or take<br>

Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy<br> 

When cold integrity keeps me wide awake<br><br>

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in<br>

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in<br><br>

Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps <br>

Slide the cotton off of your shoulder<br>

And feel the shine (feel the shine)<br>

I'm hooked so toss me over and cast a line, oh I'll try<br>

Oh, throw a party and greet my undersea friends<br>

It depends, as they arrive, if they arrive<br><br>

You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind) <br>

But I still have just one more question on my mind<br>

For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas <br>

With friends like these well, who needs enemies<br><br>

If I'm your boy, let's take a short cut we remember <br>

And we'll enjoy, picking apples in late September <br>

Like we've done for years<br>

Then we'll take a long walk through the corn field <br>

And I'll kiss you between the ears<br><br>

If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling<br>

And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling<br>

Will shine for us, as love sweeps over the room<br>

Cause we tend to make each other blush, you make me blush<br><br>

You and I left our troubles far behind, troubles far behind <br>

But I still have just one more question on my mind<br>

As he shakes my hand, and practically laughs at me <br>

"Open up nice and wide" he says peering in <br>

And with a smirk he says,<br>

"Don't have a fit, this'll just pinch a bit"<br>

As many times as I blink<br>

I'll think of you tonight<br><br>

I'll think of you tonight<br><br>

When violet eyes get brighter<br>

And heavy wings grow lighter<br>

I'll taste the sky and feel alive again<br><br>

And I'll forget the world that I knew<br>

But I swear I won't forget you<br>

Oh if my voice could reach back through the past<br>

I'd whisper in your ear:<br>

"Oh darling, I wish you were here"<br><br><br>

<a name="tidal"></a>
<b>10. Tidal Wave (with Matt Thiessen)</b><br><br>

I wish I could cross my arms, and cross your mind<br>

Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve <br>

All my life I wish I broke mirrors, instead of promises<br>

Cause all I see, is a shattered conscience staring right back at me<br><br>

I wish I had covered all my tracks completely cause I'm so afraid<br>

Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train?<br>

Lift your arms only heaven knows, where the danger grows<br>

And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way<br><br>



Help is on the way<br><br>

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity<br>

Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me<br><br>

Depression, please cut to the chase and cut a long story short<br>

Oh please be done. How much longer can this drama afford to run?<br>

Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend<br>

But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again<br>
 <br>

I forget the last time I felt brave, <br>I just recall insecurity<br>

Cause it came down like a tidal wave, <br>And sorrow swept over me<br>

Then I was given grace and love, <br>I was blind but now I can see<br>

Cause I found a new hope from above, <br>

And courage swept over me<br><br>

It hurts just to wake up, whenever you're wearing thin <br>

Alone on the outside, so tired of looking in<br>

The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid<br>

But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope<br>

And that makes me feel brave.<br>

<b>1. Hot Air Balloon</b><br><br>

We wrote a prelude to our own fairytale.<br>

And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale<br>

And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread<br>

We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.<br><br>

We round a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs<br>

And fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs.<br>

I lit a match and let it catch to light up the room.<br>

And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon<br>

Hot air balloon<br><br>

I'll be out of my mind<br>

And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.<br>

So let's spend the afternoon<br>

In a cold hot air balloon.<br><br>

Leave your jacket behind.<br>

Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.<br>

I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.<br><br>

We drank the great lakes like cold lemonade.<br>

And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade.<br>

So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.<br>

You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.<br><br>

I'll be out of my mind<br>

And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.<br>

Would you be my thunderstorm?<br>

It's cold so surround me<br>

With rain clouds to keep me warm<br>

I feel like I'm falling<br>

So darling don't let me go<br>

The thought is appalling but should I slip away<br>

Into the stormy sea will you remember me?<br><br>

Asleep in a warm cocoon<br>

We dream of lovely things<br>

We're both gonna wake up soon<br>

So we hope that tomorrow brings<br>

Us our butterfly wings<br><br>

If I was a grain of sand<br>

Would you be Miami Beach<br>

So dusty with starlight<br>

Close your eyes and cuddle close to me<br>

I'll try not to wake you<br>

Or make a sound while you're dozing off<br>

But in the night should the high tides <br>

Sweep me away from you<br> 

Tell me again my dear <br>

Will you be waiting here?<br><br>

Whenever we leave the ground<br>

And take to the sky<br>

Toupee or not toupee<br>

Please excuse the pun,<br>

"It's hair today, gone tomorrow"<br>

So be thankful<br>

For what precious locks you have<br>

Toupee or not toupee<br>

That is the question<br>

And by the way<br>

I just gotta say<br>

Thank the Lord I'm not going bald<br><br>

And if I may quip<br>

My curls and I<br>

Are just like heaven<br>

Cause rest assured<br>

There'll be no parting there<br>

But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck<br>

Our chase to swallow<br>

It makes me smile<br>

Cause I know just what I'd do<br><br>

Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with <br>

So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head<br>

Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed<br>

Pillars of postwar books supported by frame of mind<br>

While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind<br><br>

She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me<br>

The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see<br>

Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow<br>

It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now<br><br>

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible <br>

She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable <br>

We both put our sunblock on<br>

Played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn<br>

Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn<br><br>

I got a sunburn<br>
 <br>

So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been<br>

We kicked off our flip-flops and swung from the rooftops again <br>

It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about <br>

And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now<br><br>

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible <br>

Oh, afterglow, look out below<br>

We left a trail of dust behind<br>

As we parted ways, she held my gaze<br>

And left an imprint on my mind<br>

I tried not to cry as we said goodbye<br>

And hung the clouds above my town<br>

But I shed a tear when she disappeared<br>

Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground<br><br>

When her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible<br>

She gave me a heart attack<br>

We both put our sunblock on,<br>

The sun hung from a string<br>

Looking down on the world as it warmed over everything<br>

Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine<br>

And your sighs harmonize with mine<br>

Unmistakably I can still feel your heart<br>

Beat fast when you dance with me<br><br>

We got older and I should have known<br>

Do you feel alive?<br>

That I'd feel colder when I walk alone<br>

Oh, but you'll survive<br>

So I may as well ditch my dismay<br>

Bombs away, bombs away<br><br>

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully<br>

Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North <br>

Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall<br>

Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home<br><br>

It makes me smile because you said it best<br>

I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west<br>

Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you<br>

Cause your favorite shade is navy blue<br><br>

I walk slowly when I'm on my own<br>

Do you feel alive?<br>

Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone<br>

This is a world of dreams and reverie<br>

Where I felt the stars explode around me<br>

A grass blade flashed with a gleam<br> 

Ss it slashed open a moonbeam <br>

And I stared back breathlessly<br>

As mountains of fruit tumbled out <br>

I barely had the chance to shout <br>

Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me<br><br>

Staying awake that night was rather hard<br>

Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard<br>

When we woke up buried alive<br>

Beneath the fruity landslide<br>

We both laughed hysterically<br>

It could've been just another dream<br>

But, I swear I heard you scream<br>

Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me<br>
 <br>

Oh, there's a citrus constellation in the galaxy<br>

Scratched on the back of both my eyelids<br>

That I've been dying to see<br>

If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around <br>

Then I'd be your harmony<br>

And we'd sing along with the crowds<br>

Beneath the candy coated clouds<br>

Oh strawberry avalanche please crash over me<br><br>

I saw the autumn leaves<br>

Peel up off the street<br>

Take wing on the balmy breeze<br>

And sweep you off your feet<br>

And you blushed as they scooped you up<br>

On sugar maple wings<br>

To gaze down on the city below<br>

Ablaze with wondrous things<br><br>

Downy feathers kiss your face<br>

And flutter everywhere<br>

Reality is a lovely place<br>

But I wouldn't wanna live there<br>

Weighed down by heavy lids<br>

And lunar lullabies<br>

Cause you smile with your eyes<br><br>

Downy feathers kiss your face<br>

And flutter everywhere<br>

Reality is a lovely place<br>

But I wouldn't wanna live there<br><br>

From the green belt balcony<br>

The wildfires look so pretty<br>

Ponderosa canopy<br>

I'd never leave if it were up to me<br>

To the ruby redwood tree<br>

And to the velvet climbing ivy<br>

Painted all mahogany<br>

I'd never leave if it were up to me<br>

If it were up to me<br><br>

With a starry brush<br>

Paint the dusk venetian blue<br>

Cause in the evening hush<br>

You'll never believe the view<br>

And when the leaves return<br>

And their whisperings fill the night<br>

They'll freeze and burn<br>

Where fire and ice collide<br>

Where fire and ice collide<br><br>

Can you feel a silk embrace<br>

In the satin air?<br>

If we dissolve without a trace<br>

Will the real world even care?<br>

And flutter everywhere<br>

Reality is a lovely place<br>

But I wouldn't wanna live there<br>

They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says: "Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy." The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.

<b>10. Alligator Sky (with Shawn Christopher)<br><br></b>

Where was I when the rockets came to life,<br>

And carried you away into the alligator sky?<br>

Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,<br>

I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go<br><br>

Uh uh, that's not a plane, that's me,<br>

I'm sittin' where I'm supposed to,<br>

Floatin' on the cloud, can't nobody come close to, <br>

The concrete and the sky switch places,<br>

So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces,<br>

Firecracker to the moon, keep your eyes shut,<br>

Blastin' off like a rocket from the ground up,<br>

I used to catch a cab on the Monday,<br>

Now the taxi's sellin' lights on the runway,<br>

Fly, condo on the Milky Way,<br>

A house on the cloud and God's my landlord,<br>

And for my rent all I pay is my drive,<br>

I got that<br>

So if you need me you can find me in the alligator sky.<br><br>

Where was I when the rockets came to life, <br>

And carried you away into the alligator sky?<br> (Into the alligator sky)<br>

Even though I'll never know what's up ahead, <br>

I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!<br><br>

Roller coaster through the atmosphere,<br>

I'm drowning in this starry serenade,<br>

Where ecstasy becomes cavalier,<br>

My imagination's taking me away.<br><br>

Reverie, whisper in my ear,<br>

I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid,<br>

Roller coaster through the atmosphere,<br>

My imagination's taking me away.<br><br>

Uh, now I'ma dance like I never dance,<br>

Sing like I never sing, dream like I never dream, <br>

Or try to, cause we've been lied to,<br>

That the sun is somethin' that we can't fly to,<br>

Well, I sit on my star and see street lights,<br>

Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice,<br>

Imagination is hot and if you got it you can meet me,<br>

When you see me in the alligator sky.<br><br>

Where was I when the rockets came to life<br>

And carried you away into the alligator sky<br>

(Into the alligator sky)<br>

<b>11. The Yacht Club (with Lights)<br><br></b>

My raw candy passion is bittersweet<br>

And armed to the teeth<br>

Cause she would rather fall in chocolate<br>

Than fall in love<br>

Especially with me<br>

I stood under the waterfall<br>

With a kiwi-pineapple parasol<br>

As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball<br>

And made a concrete cavern<br>

A caterpillar concert hall<br><br>

I wish that we could sail our sad days away<br>

Forever<br>

In deep blue seas of paper-mache<br>

Let's dance in the moonlight<br>

A barracuda chased our dog days away<br>

Forever<br>

Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love<br>

And dance in the moonlight<br>

When we join the yacht club<br><br>

I would rather go swimming<br>

With great white sharks<br>

Than wade in romance<br>

Cause I can never find the courage<br>

To ask her to dinner<br>

Or even to dance<br>

(Dance in the moonlight)<br><br>

Don't sweat under your overcoat<br>

Cause my heart can harbor this paddle boat<br>

You'll hit the bottom of the highest note<br>

And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna<br>

Leave your throat<br><br>

I wish that we could sail our sad days away<br> 

Forever<br>

In deep blue seas of paper mache<br>

(Let's dance in the moonlight)<br>

A barracuda chased our dog days away<br>

Forever<br>

Let's sink or swim till we fall in love<br>

And dance in the moonlight<br>

When we join the yacht club<br><br>



Let go of the world you know<br>

And plug in the partying lights<br>

Soak your cares in the solar flares<br>

That light up these island nights<br>

Orange eclipse I can taste your lips<br>

In the citrus afternoon<br>

If you can fly don't stop at the sky<br>

Cause there's footprints on the moon, it was you<br><br>

I wish that we could sail our sad days away<br>

Forever<br>

In deep blue seas of paper mache<br>

Let's dance in the moonlight<br>

A barracuda chased our dog days away<br>

Forever<br>

Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love<br>

And dance in the moonlight<br>

<b>12. Plant Life<br><br></b>

I saw a ghost on the stairs<br>

And sheets on the tables and chairs<br>

The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink<br>

Even so, I don't know what to think<br><br>

I've been longing for daisies to push through the floor<br>

And I wish plant life would grow all around me<br>

So I won't feel dead anymore<br>

So I won't feel dead anymore<br><br>

I saw a bear in the den<br>

Reading my textbooks again<br>

The bats flowed like traffic<br>

As they poured from the attic<br>

Heaven knows I could really use a friend<br><br>

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest<br>

The trees keep the tempo and they swing in time<br>

Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus<br>

If I were to pluck on your heart strings<br>

Would you strum on mine?<br><br>

I've been longing for daisies to push through the floor <br>

I've never really felt like this before<br>

And I wish plant life would grow all around me<br>

So I won't feel dead anymore<br>

So I won't feel dead anymore<br><br>

Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet<br>

And give me a ghost of a smile<br>

Show me your teeth cause you're a teddy beneath<br> 

So just grin and bear it a while<br>

Just grin and bear it a while<br><br>

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest<br>

If I were to pluck on your heart strings<br>

Would you strum on mine?<br><br>

(The brook babbles on about nothing at all)<br>

(New leaf turns over, unwilling to fall)<br>
 <br>

Tonight I'm busting out of this old haunted house<br> 

Cause I'm sick of waiting for<br>

All those spider webs to grow all around me<br>

Cause I don't feel dead anymore<br>

And I'm not afraid anymore<br><br>

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest<br>

<b>13. How I Became The Sea<br><br></b>

June was the lobster shell<br>

I dug by hand<br>

A haven that hid me well<br>

Beneath the sand<br>

The wide windy waves washed in<br>

But I stayed dry<br>

The great breakers broke again<br>

As I nodded off inside<br><br>

And then<br>

When the Empress ran aground<br>

And my eyes turned blue and green<br>

I heard a gorgeous sound<br>

And that's when it became a dream<br>

When the sky fell in<br>

When the hurricanes came for me<br>

I could finally crash again<br>

And that's how I became the sea<br><br>

I wrenched the engines off<br>

And drank them down<br>

The depths turned the iron soft<br>

As they swiftly drowned<br>

And I brought the ocean side<br>

To its rusty knees<br>

As I felt the even tide<br>

Deep in my shallow dreams<br><br>

And then<br>

When the Empress ran aground<br>

And my eyes turned blue and green<br>

I heard a gorgeous sound<br>

And that's when it became a dream<br>

When the sky fell in<br>

When the hurricanes came for me<br>

I could finally crash again<br>

And that's how I became the sea<br><br>

Remember to breathe, because it'll take your breath away,<br>

When the engines cough, and you blast off.<br>

Ignite the night with a firecracker flash.<br>

Remember to live, cause you're gonna be thrilled to death,<br>

When the stars collide and your eyes grow wide.<br>

Take it in with your breath against the glass.<br>

Remember to dream because it's gonna be a starry night, <br>

Over every town, if you look down.<br>

So harmonize with the singing satellites.<br>

Remember to scream because you're gonna be lost for words, <br>

When the sparks erupt and they light you up.<br>

Dip your toes in the galaxy cause it's yours to explore tonight.<br><br>

We were alone on the road driving faster<br>

So far from home we were chasing disaster<br>

Hard on the gas till the car caught on fire<br>

We had to laugh as the smoked billowed higher <br><br>

I wanna feel alive forever after<br>

And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after <br>

And I, and I, and I say<br><br>

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters <br>

Follow the light to the edge and the after <br>

We won't turn around, we will not slow down <br>

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters<br><br>

Think of the sun, and the sound of it rising <br>

Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon<br>

I wanna feel alive forever after<br>

And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after <br>

Way up in the air, you're finally free<br>

And you can stay up there right next to me<br>

And fan the flames so hot it melts our hearts<br>

Into a million sparks that all disperse<br>

And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down <br>

<b>8. Embers<br><br></b>

There were days when each hour <br>

Was a war I fought to survive<br>

There were nights full of nightmares <br>

And I dreaded closing my eyes<br>

There were skies that burst open <br>

With a downpour to drown me alive<br>

But the world took a spark like a match in the dark<br>

And the fire brought me to life<br><br>

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high <br>

Cause there's no other way we can stay alive<br>

Cause we're burning bright<br>

As we all unite<br>

And when it's all said and done<br>

We'll shine like the sun<br>

So don't let the fire die<br>

And we'll watch the sky<br>

As it fills with light<br>

And though the embers are new<br>

Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die<br><br>

And you'll find there'll be mornings<br>

When the ashes and embers are cold<br>

But you'll fight with a passion<br>

And you'll never stop cause you know<br>

Yeah you know, it gets better<br>

And your story is yet to be told<br>

Every push, every shove, every war, every love<br>

Yeah, the coals are beginning to glow<br><br>

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high <br>

Cause there's no other way we can stay alive<br>

Cause we're burning bright<br>

As we all unite<br>

And when it's all said and done<br>

We'll shine like the sun<br>

So don't let the fire die<br>

And we'll watch the sky<br>

As it fills with light<br>

And though the embers are new<br>

Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die<br>

Don't let the fire die<br><br>

It gets better<br>

Just don't let the fire die, no<br><br>

Cause we're burning bright<br>

As we all unite<br>

And when it's all said and done<br>

We'll shine like the sun<br>

So don't let the fire die<br>

And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light<br>

<b>9. Silhouette<br></b>

I'm tired of waking up in tears<br>

Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears<br>

I'm new to this grief I can't explain<br>

But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain<br><br>

The fire I began is burning me alive<br>

But I know better than to leave and let it die<br>

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then 

Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?<br>

I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own<br>

But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone <br>

So I watch the summer stars to lead me home<br><br>

I'm sick of the past I can't erase<br>

A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace<br> 

The mountain of things I still regret<br>

Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget<br> 

(no matter where I go)<br><br>

The fire I began is burning me alive<br>

But I know better than to leave and let it die<br>

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then <br>

Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?<br>


I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own<br>

But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone <br>

So I watch the summer stars to lead me home<br><br>

Cause I walk alone<br>

No matter where I go<br>

Cause I walk alone<br>

No matter where I go<br>

Cause I walk alone<br>

No matter where I go<br><br>

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then<br>

Oh, oh, I left my heart in metropolis<br><br>

So far apart, I checked but the coast was clear<br>

I feel like a postcard<br>

I wish you were here<br>

Subway through the dark, carriage through the park<br>

Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet<br>

Don't matter much to me what it is that I do<br>

As long as I'm coming home to you<br><br>

Oh, oh, oh, as far as I can see<br>

You're the only one, the only one who can get to me <br>

Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train<br>

Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this <br>

I left my heart in metropolis<br><br>

A thousand miles feels like a million years<br>

Like hundreds of postcards that say<br>

I wish you were here (I can't even take it in) <br>

Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by <br>

Dirt bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea<br> 

Don't matter much to me what it is that I do <br>

<b>11. Take It All Away<br><br></b>


There was a shot in the dark, I was caught by surprise<br>

There was a hole in my heart, there were tears in your eyes<br>

And there was nothing to say cause you made up your mind<br>

So I guess what you meant when you left was goodbye<br><br>

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely grave <br>

I won't let it show until you've finally flown away<br><br>

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say<br>

You wanna take it all away, take it all away<br><br>

You tear me up when you say<br>

You wanna take it all away, take it all away<br>

You were the one and it was enough<br>

To be the one you were dreaming of<br>

You were the one and we called it love<br>

And now you take it all away, take it all away<br><br>

I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek<br> 

And as I try to digest the words I couldn't believe<br>

I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve<br> 

Making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe<br><br>

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely grave <br>

I won't let it show until you've finally flown away<br><br>

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say<br>

She wound a thread around the pieces of, my broken heart <br>

And left me to believe<br>

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave<br>

A starry night without a fear of heights<br>

I can't recall, cause I learned after all<br>

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall<br><br>

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn<br>

As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn<br>

While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe<br>

As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me<br><br>

I miss the way she whispered in my ear<br>

Before she left, and had me so convinced <br>

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave<br>

And Juliet's romantic balcony<br>

Wears out the wall, but I learned after all <br>

That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall<br><br>

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn<br>

As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn<br>

While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe<br>

As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me<br><br>

When you're alone<br>

I hope my ghost, never leaves<br>

Cause when I'm home<br>

Your painful memory, is always haunting me<br><br>

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn<br>

As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn<br>

While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe<br>

As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing me<br><br>

When I see you around, my eyes go wide<br>

When you race through my mind, I die inside<br>

While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe<br>

As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me<br><br>

I hope you think of me, I hope you think of me<br>

<b>1. Beautiful Times (feat. Lindsay Stirling)<br><br></b>

A spark soaring down through the pouring rain<br>

And restoring life to the lighthouse<br>

A slow motion wave on the ocean<br>

Stirs my emotion up like a rain cloud<br>

When did the sky turn black?<br>

And when will the light come back?<br><br>

A cab driver turned to skydiver<br>

Then to survivor,<br>

Dying to breakdown<br>

A blood brother, surrogate mother,<br>

Hugging each other, crying their eyes out<br>

When did the sky turn black?<br>

And when will the light come back?<br><br>

I'm ecstatic like a drug addict<br>

Locked in the attic<br>

Strung out and spellbound<br><br>

I fought all through the night<br>

Oh, oh, but I made it alive<br>

The sun's starting to rise<br>

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times<br>

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard<br>

But I'm gonna survive<br>

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times<br><br>

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling<br>

Leaving my healing heart with a new scar<br>

A dead fire rose and rose higher<br>

Like a vampire, up from the graveyard<br>

When did the sky turn black?<br>

And when will the light come back?<br><br>

We all suffer but we recover<br>

Just to discover life where we all are<br>
 <br>

I fought all through the night<br>

Oh, oh, but I made it alive<br>

The sun's starting to rise<br>

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times<br>

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard <br>

But I'm gonna survive<br>

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times<br><br>

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard <br>

But I'm gonna survive<br>

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times<br>

My heart's burning bad<br>

And it's turning black<br>

But I'm learning how to be stronger<br>

And sincerely, I love you dearly<br>

Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander.<br><br><br>

Like a waterfall<br>

And I swear I could feel you in my arms<br>

But there was no one there at all<br><br>

You were my clarity, I swear<br>

All alone in a daydream<br>

Yeah there was magic in the air<br>

And you were right here beside me<br>

Held down like an angel with no wings<br>

And now I'm gonna be up all night<br>

I just can't get you off my mind<br><br>

I tossed and turned in the end<br>

With no one to talk to<br>

I searched again and again<br>

But I never found you<br>

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes<br>

Like a waterfall<br>

And I swear I could feel you in my arms<br>

<b>3. This Isn't The End<br><br></b>

An eight-year-old girl had a panic attack<br>

Cause the father she loved left and never looked back<br> 

No longer the hero she counted on<br>

He told her he loved her and then he was gone<br><br>

She tried to look happy in front of her friends<br>

But knew that she'd never feel normal again<br>

She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes<br>

And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye<br><br>

When the rain falls down<br>

When it all turns around<br>

When the light goes out<br>

This isn't the end<br><br>

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked<br> 

But nobody knew he was dying inside<br>

He promised his family they'd be alright <br>

And then with a gunshot he left them behind<br><br>

When the rain falls down<br>

When it all turns around<br>

When the light goes out<br>

The role of a father he never deserved<br>

He abandoned his daughter and never returned<br>

And over the years though the pain was real<br>

She finally forgave him and started to heal<br><br>

How close is the ending, well, nobody knows<br>

The future's a mystery and anything goes<br>

Love is confusing and life is hard<br>

You fight to survive cause you made it this far<br><br>

It's all too astounding to comprehend<br>

It's just the beginning this isn't the end<br><br>

It's just the beginning this isn't the end<br><br><br>

I hold my breath, and close my eyes<br><br>

I don't have a lot left<br>

Oh, how did it end so fast?<br>

I say, with my last breath<br>

It's a perfect day, to float away<br><br>

When the sparks, flew between us<br>

I saw you glow, and had to know<br>

Where our journey would lead us<br>

Till the story end, and back again<br>

Yeah I, I felt like I could fly<br>

Cause I, I found love<br><br>

So lead me home, and lift me up<br>

Above the stars, and even higher<br>

It falls like rain, and burns like fire<br><br>

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough <br>

So I could buy C-3PO <br>

Put Mentos in my Diet Coke <br>

In the backseat of the bus<br>

When I was a kid I ate Spaghetti-Os, <br>

Played laser tag and G.I. Joes <br>

And if you vowed "no girls allowed", <br>

Then you could join the club <br>

When I was a kid I spent my Saturdays <br>

Blowin' on Nintendo games<br>

The newest thing was Lion King, <br>

And I could feel the love<br><br>

Stayed up late watching action films<br>

And I won't lie, my friends and I, <br>

Were too legit to quit<br>

When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, <br>

Ate Dr. Pepper jellybeans <br>

My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" <br>

Was how real the raptors looked <br>

When I was a kid I still had VHS, <br>

Watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff <br>

Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, <br>

And it was off the hook!<br><br>

<b>6. Bird With A Broken Wing<br><br></b>

So I walk alone down the darkest roads <br>

Cause I've always known how the story goes <br>

When the curtain falls, I'll be wearing thin <br>

Clawing at the walls as they're closing in <br>

In this twisted plot I was destined for <br>

I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor <br>

So misunderstood 'till the bloody end <br>

How I wish I could do it all again<br>
 <br>

It feels like I'm a lone survivor<br>

Forgotten in a dark and deadly world<br>

And on my own I walk alone<br>

To see the sun again I'd give anything<br>

But life demands a final chapter<br>

A story that we all must leave behind<br>

It's do or die, and this is mine<br>

The anthem of a bird with a broken wing<br><br>

It's another night of the living dead<br>

Like a viper bite in a spider web<br>

It's so deathly dark in the alleyway<br>

And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey<br>

I would run and hide for the afternoon<br>

With the butterfly in the panic room<br>

Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time <br>

For a different twist in the story line<br><br>

It feels like I'm a lone survivor<br>

Forgotten in a dark and deadly world<br>

And on my own I walk alone<br>

To see the sun again I'd give anything<br>

The anthem of a bird with a broken wing<br>

The anthem of a bird with a broken wing<br>

The anthem of a bird with a broken wing<br><br>

Tell the world I know that my mind is made<br>

It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid<br>

Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time <br>

For a different twist in the story line<br>

And said "it's time to leave"<br>
So they jumped in the old Caprice<br>
And tore off into the night<br>
On the 4th of July<br>

They flew through the darkness<br>
Driving like Jehu<br>
And they rolled into Ottumwa<br>
Before the sun begun to rise<br>

To peek in through the window<br>
Hoping to hear her grandson cry<br>
On the 4th of July<br>

My mother watched the fireworks<br>
From her hospital bed<br>
And after it was all over<br>
She held me for the first time<br>
On the 5th of July<br>

And my dad's quiet way<br>
And Grandma Rachel's love for music<br>
The morning I arrived<br>
On the 5th of July<br>
<br>
Deeping in Iowa country<br>
And a heavenly hideaway<br>
On the shores of Lake Rathbun<br>
My folks brought me home<br>
On the 5th of July<br>
<br>
That was when (that was when)<br>
Life began (life began)<br>
For me<br>
That was when (that was when)<br>
Life began (life began)<br>
For me<br>

A teacher and a mechanic<br>
Brought me into this world<br>
They loved me with all their hearts since<br>
The day I opened my eyes<br>
On the 5th of July<br>
<br>
That was when (that was when)<br>
Life began (life began)<br>
For me<br>

<b>3. All My Friends</b><br><br>
It's been this way from the start<br>
It's like they're always trying to tear us apart<br>
But we will stand strong, stand true<br>
And everybody's gonna watch what we do<br>
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks<br>
They either got real good or they got real good luck<br>
<br>
And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more<br>
Cause I've been on my own, trying like never before<br>

<b>4. House Wren</b><br><br>
I'm a house wren hunting for a house<br>
I haven't found one, I'm on the lookout<br>
For a home to call my own<br>
A private residence<br>
Through the grapevine I heard an empty gourd<br>
Is hanging up somewhere on some old lady's porch<br>
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go<br>
To my new humble abode<br>
<br>
I'm gonna sing<br>
At the top of my lungs<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day<br>
I'm gonna spread my wings<br>
'Cause as far as I know<br>
I am halfway home<br>
<br>
I'm a house wren who needs a summer home<br>
A country farm house or a quiet bungalow<br>
Not too big, and not too small<br>
First-rate real estate<br>
I got my eyes peeled for a window box<br>
An old tin can, a boot or a flower pot<br>
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go<br>
To my new humble abode<br>
<br>
I'm gonna sing<br>
At the top of my lungs<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day<br>
I'm gonna spread my wings<br>
'Cause as far as I know<br>
I am half way home<br>
<br>
I'm a house wren still hunting for a house<br>
But I got a song and a lot to sing about<br>
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go (off I'll go)<br>
Because you know<br>
<br>
I'm gonna sing<br>
At the top of my lungs<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day<br>
I'm gonna spread my wings<br>
I'm on top of the world<br>
And it's a beautiful thing<br>
<br>
I'm gonna sing<br>
At the top of my lungs<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day<br>
I'm gonna spread my wings<br>
'Cause as far as I know<br>

<b>5. Not All Heroes Wear Capes</b><br><br>
He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape<br>
He doesn't read minds or levitate<br>
But every time my world needs saving, he's my superman<br>
Some folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad<br>
<br>
He loves his workshop and rock and roll<br>
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold<br>
And you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within<br>
And even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him<br>
<br>
He built me a house in the arms of a tree<br>
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream<br>
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see<br>
That my dad's a hero to me<br>
<br>
Rust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings<br>
Somehow he can fix about anything<br>
I didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year<br>
He doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear<br>
<br>
He built me a house in the arms of a tree<br>
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream<br>
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see<br>
That my dad's a hero to me<br>

<b>6. Montana</b><br><br>
A fifteen year old kid from Saint Paul<br>
Hopped on a train and headed west<br>
Got a job at a Saint Mary restaurant<br>
Washing dishes and making friends<br>
<br>
The years went by like the seasons<br>
And they brought him a lifetime of joy<br>
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven<br>
With a paradise vantage point<br>
<br>
And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains<br>
That stole his heart when he was a boy<br>
<br>
On North Fork Road you're almost home<br>
<br>
Get lost in Montana<br>
Where your heart can finally roam<br>
Get lost in Montana<br>
Where the mountains call you home<br>
Get lost forever in Montana<br>
<br>
His son worked hard in West Glacier<br>
His daughter sold souvenirs<br>
And he always went back to Polebridge<br>
With his family every year<br>
<br>
To his green tin roof in the Rockies<br>
And his sky so full of stars<br>
His spirit lives in these mountains<br>
Where Montana first stole his heart<br>
<br>
On North Fork Road you're almost home<br>
<br>
Get lost in Montana<br>
Where your heart can finally roam<br>
Get lost in Montana<br>
Where the mountains call you home<br>
Get lost forever in Montana<br>
<br>
Two words on a bumper sticker<br>
Were all I needed to read<br>
I found myself for the first time<br>
When Montana enchanted me<br>
<br>
So get lost in the Big Sky country<br>
Where adventure calls your name<br>
Every moment is worth more than diamonds<br>
When you spend time in the treasure state<br>
<br>
So get lost in the Big Sky country<br>
And let your heart lead the way<br>

<b>7. Lucid Dream</b><br><br>

I am a light sleeper<br>
But I am a heavy dreamer<br>
My imagination gives me wings<br>
And I can go anywhere<br>
<br>
And when I wander away, to some other place<br>
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air<br>
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames<br>
And that black rabbit of death<br>
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams<br>
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain<br>
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain<br>
<br>
Do you believe in endless miracles?<br>
Do you believe in the impossible?<br>
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?<br>
Do you believe in curiosity?<br>

<b>11. Madeline Island</b><br><br>
We bought a tent and some sleeping bags<br>
And we jumped in the truck<br>
North bound on I-35<br>
Before the sun came up<br>
<br>
We stopped for lunch in Kanow Park<br>
Passing through the Louvre<br>
Rolled into Bayfield, Wisconsin<br>
And there she was<br>
Madeline Island<br>
<br>
We left our cares on the mainland<br>
Boarded a ferry boat<br>
We saw La Pointe for the first time<br>
And we felt right at home<br>
<br>
Drove out to Big Bay State Park<br>
Picked out our campsite<br>
We settled in underneath the stars<br>
And there we were<br>
<br>
Out there in the great Lake Superior<br>
Right across the bay<br>
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were<br>
Half a world away<br>
<br>
Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves<br>
With every passing day<br>
It was all a blur, but there we were<br>
On Madeline Island<br>
Madeline Island<br>
<br>
We left our shadows on the lake shore<br>
We soaked up all the sights<br>
About drowned in a downpour<br>
But for the northern lights<br>
<br>
We shot the breeze under pine trees<br>
And sat around the fire<br>
We hit the hay beneath the Milky Way<br>
And there we were<br>

<b>12. Be Brave</b><br><br>
In a basement of an empty house<br>
I slept on the floor like a vagrant<br>
I braved a Minnesota winter night<br>
And drove to a movie feeling lonely<br>
And as I thawed my heart out by the light<br>
Of the silver screen<br>
I was unaware that you were there In the dark<br>
A silhouette was climbing up the stairs<br>
<br>
And what I thought in the parking lot<br>
Was like I just wanna know your name<br>
I drove away with not much to say<br>
But in my hand I held the paper bird<br>
And written on it were the words<br>
"Be brave"<br>
<br>
Wildflower knew I wasn't well<br>
But on the kitchen floor I got better again<br>
I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star<br>
And there I was understood for the first time in my life<br>
Cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity<br>
I knew it when you showed up again<br>
In the snow yeah I was always told<br>
Your heart is where you're home<br>
<br>
And what I thought in the coffee shop<br>
Was like the last eight hours was a dream<br>
I drove away with not much to say<br>
But in my hand I held a paper bird<br>
And written on it were the words<br>
<br>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>

And in my mind<br>
After all this time I think<br>
"Ain't life beautiful and strange?"<br>
I'm blown away<br>
With no words to say<br>
Cause I'll forever be amazed<br>
How I learned the meaning of the phrase<br>
"Be brave"<br>

<b>Lonely Lullaby<br></b><br>

Symphony of silver tears,<br>

Sing to me <br>

And sooth the ring in my ears,<br>

Overcast <br>

These gloomy nights wear on,<br>

But I'm holding fast <br>

Because it's darkest just before the dawn.<br><br>

I sang my princess fast asleep,<br>

Cause she was my dream come true,<br>

Oh Anne Marie, believe me, I loved you.<br>

But now those lonely lullabies,<br>

Just dampen my tired eyes,<br>

Because I can't forget you.<br>

Because I can't forget you.<br><br>

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,<br>

When the nightmares take me,<br>

I will scream with the howling wind,<br>

Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.<br><br>

Dizzy love <br>

Turned a star lily pink,<br>

And hung above <br>

Our lids too flushed to blink, <br>

But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,<br>

Though I treasured you <br>

And you sparkled with someone to hold.<br><br>

I sang my princess fast asleep,<br>

Cause she was my dream come true,<br>

Oh Anne Marie, believe me, I loved you.<br>

But now those lonely lullabies,<br>

Just dampen my tired eyes,<br>

Because I can't forget you.<br>

Because I can't forget you.<br><br>

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,<br>

When the nightmares take me,<br>

I will scream with the howling wind,<br>

Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.<br><br>

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,<br>

When the nightmares take me,<br>

I will scream with the howling wind,<br>

Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.<br><br>

And I'd rather dream.<br><br>

Anne Marie, I'll never forget you.<br>

Anne Marie, I'll never forget you.<br><br>

Anne Marie, remember me?<br>

<b>To The Sky<br><br></b>

Shipwreck in a sea of faces<br>

There's a dreamy world up there<br>

Dear friends in higher places<br>

Carry me away from here<br>

Travel light, let the sun eclipse you<br>

Cause your flight is about to leave<br>

And there's more to this brave adventure<br>

Than you'd ever believe<br><br>

Birds-eye view, awake the stars cause they're all around you <br>

Wide eyes will always brighten the blue<br>

Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery<br>

Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high<br>

So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>

And take to the sky (you take to the sky)<br><br>

On the hills of war and wonder<br>

There's a stormy world up there<br>

You can't whisper above the thunder<br>

But you can fly anywhere<br>

Purple burst of paper birds<br>

This picture paints a thousand words<br>

So take a breath of myth and mystery<br>

And don't look back<br><br>

Birds-eye view, awake the stars cause they're all around you <br>

Wide eyes will always brighten the blue<br>

Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery<br>

Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high<br>

So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>

And take to the sky (you take to the sky)<br><br>

There's a realm above the trees<br>

Where the lost are finally found<br>

So touch your feathers to the breeze<br>

And leave the ground<br><br>

Birds-eye view, awake the stars cause they're all around you<br>

Wide eyes will always brighten the blue<br>

Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery<br>

Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high<br>

So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>

And take to the sky<br>

You take to the sky.<br><br><br>

<b>Tokyo (with SEKAI NO OWARI)<br><br></b>

Feels like I've been away for a thousand years<br>

So tired of these airports and souvenirs<br>

I shiver in the night and I think of you<br><br>

I stroll the boulevards<br>

I stare up at the stars<br>

And wish they'd all align <br>

Ooh, can't sleep the whole night through<br>

Ooh, when I am missing you<br>

I'm thinking it out loud<br>

I wish I could reach out<br>

And hold you close<br>

When I'm in Tokyo (when I'm in Tokyo)<br><br>

I wander all alone in the pouring rain<br>

Ride shotgun on the wind in a bullet train<br>

I shiver in the night and I think of you<br><br>

I stare up at the stars<br>

And wish they'd all align<br>

<b>Peppermint Winter<br><br></b>

There's the snow<br>

Look out below<br>

And bundle up<br>

Cause here it comes<br>

Run outside<br>

So starry eyed<br>

A snowball fight breaks out<br>

And winter has finally begun<br><br>

I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace<br>

Till I slip on the sidewalk and fall on my face<br>

This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet<br>

I don't need to taste to believe<br>

What's December without Christmas Eve<br><br>

Hop in the sleigh<br>

And we'll glide away<br>

Into the night<br>

And we'll sip on moonlight<br>

Runny nose<br>

My frosty toes<br>

Are getting cold but I feel alive<br>

So I smile wide<br>
<br>

The snowflakes start falling and I start to float<br>

Till my mean older brother stuffs snow down my coat<br>

This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet<br>

I don't need to taste to believe<br>

What's December without Christmas Eve<br><br>

All this holiday cheer<br>

Heaven knows where it goes<br>

But it returns every year<br>

And though this winter does nothing but storm<br>

The joy in my heart is ablaze and it's keeping me warm<br>

It's keeping me warm<br><br>

It's keeping me warm<br><br>

I rip off the wrapping and tear through the box<br>

Till I end up with 45 new pairs of socks<br>

This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet<br>

I don't need to taste to believe<br>

What's December without Christmas Eve.<br><br>

<b>Paper Tigers<br><br></b>

Well I've been huddled up alone<br>

By the fire even though<br>

I'm not exactly feeling cold<br>

And I've been bundled up for days<br>

Too confused to be amazed<br>

At all the icy water in my veins<br>

Why do I feel so alone?<br><br>

Yeah I've been moving in and out<br>

Of this old split-level house<br>

And I'd just as soon burn the whole place down<br>

Cause I quit working lumberyards<br>

To build a mansion out of cards<br>

But I feel thin behind these paper walls<br>

Why do I feel so alone?<br><br>

Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite<br>

Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite<br>

But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right<br>

That makes every love lost just a holiday every night<br><br>

Well I've been painting through the night<br>

In the basement out of sight<br>

Brushing paper tigers black and white<br>

Cause come tomorrow afternoon<br>

I'll fill a helium balloon<br>

And set them free into the baby blue sky<br>

So they won&'t have to be alone<br><br>

Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite<br>

Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite<br>

But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right<br>

That makes every love lost just a holiday every night<br><br>

But when I close these heavy lids after dark<br> 

Each sweet dream is a target<br>

And all my shots are so consistently wide of the mark<br><br>

Cause the angriest bark is always worse than the bite<br>

Like the ache in my chest that my heart didn't invite<br>

But if the prettiest romance isn't perfectly right<br>

That makes every love lost just a holiday every night<br><br>

Just a holiday every night<br>

Just a holiday every night<br>

Just a holiday every night<br><br>

Well I've been huddled up alone<br>

By the fire even though<br>

I'm not exactly feeling cold<br><br>

But how my heartache hit the trail<br>

When a paper tiger tail<br>

Fluttered down, I guess I'll never know<br><br><br>

<b>Beautiful Mystery<br><br></b>

When I'm dressed to the nines<br>

I'm just a shirt and tie<br>

With a taste for prestige<br>

And beautiful mystery<br>

But clever girls dressed to kill<br>

Are pretty bittersweet<br>

And better suited for grief<br>

Than beautiful mystery<br>

Oh beautiful mystery<br><br>

Fly by feather, <br>

This time I'm not ready to die <br>

But I lose myself<br>

Oh, oh, I'm falling for you<br>

Now or never, <br>

Stand back cause I'm ready to fly <br>

But I lose myself<br>

Oh, oh, I'm falling for you<br><br>

She enjoys it the most<br>

With flowers in her hair<br>

Dressing up like a ghost<br>

For beautiful mystery<br>

And so I kiss her goodnight<br>

And stumble from the room<br>

Mighty high on mystique<br>

And beautiful mystery<br>

Oh beautiful mystery<br><br>

Fly by feather, <br>

<b>Enchanted<br></b><br>

There I was again tonight <br>

Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>

Same old tired, lonely place<br>

Walls of insincerity<br>

Shifting eyes and vacancy <br>

Vanished when I saw your face <br><br>

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br><br>

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"<br>

Across the room your silhouette <br>

Starts to make its way to me <br>

The playful conversation starts<br>

Counter all your quick remarks like <br>

Passing notes in secrecy<br><br>

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br>

Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too<br><br>

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>

I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>

I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>

I was enchanted to meet you too<br><br>

The lingering question kept me up<br>

2AM, who do you love?<br>

I wondered till I'm wide awake<br>

Now I'm pacing back and forth, <br>

Wishing you were at my door<br>

I'd open up and you would say,<br>

Hey it was enchanting to meet you<br><br>

Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too<br><br>

This is me praying that <br>

This was the very first page <br>

Not where the story line ends<br>

My thoughts will echo your name <br>

Until I see you again<br>

These are the words I held back <br>

As I was leaving too soon<br>

I was enchanted to meet you too<br><br>

Please don't be in love with someone else<br>

Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>

Please don't be in love with someone else<br>

Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br><br>

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>

I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>

I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br><br>

This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>

I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>

Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew <br>

<b>The Joy in Your Heart<br><br></b>

I'm the snow<br>

Look out below<br>

And bundle up<br>

Cause here I come<br>

Skies of grey<br>

This holiday<br>

But spirits shine so bright<br>

They don't need the sun<br><br>

Cause love is the fire<br>

In your fireplace<br>

And carefree are the snowflakes<br>

That fall on your face<br>

And although this winter<br>

May bring us a storm<br>

The joy in your heart<br>

Keeps you warm<br><br>

Yeah, the joy in your heart<br>

Keeps you warm<br><br><br>

I can feel you in the rising tide<br>

Can you feel me by the fire side<br>

From the moonlight<br>

Through the cherry trees<br>

Open the roof and take in the view<br>

Cause you're my sweetest dream<br>

Come true<br><br>

Color the dusk, deep navy blue<br>

And try to be brave<br>

Cause I'll be right beside you<br>

There's a world so high<br>

Hold out your hands<br>

And you can go anywhere<br>

So reach for the stars<br>

Cause I'll be waiting up there<br>

And you can finally fly<br>

Cause you'll be lighter than air<br><br>

<b>Eternity (by Paul van Dyk)<br><br></b>

When I lift off<br>

When both my feet leave the ground<br>

Will you be there where the skyline ends?<br>

When I take flight<br>

When the blackest night calls me home<br>

Will you be there when dream begins?<br><br>

The smallest drop in the ocean<br>

Can start a wave of emotion<br>

My dear I wish I could hold you<br>

Safe in my arms from here to Eternity<br>

Alone I know you'll be waiting<br>

Where the moonbeams lean down to kiss me <br>

Cause your beauty burns through the darkness <br>

Crystal and clear from here to Eternity<br><br>

When I let go, when I release all my cares<br>

Will you be there where nightmare ends?<br>

When I drift off<br>

When the silver sun calls my name<br>

Will you be there where the light begins?<br><br>

The smallest drop in the ocean<br>

Can start a wave of emotion<br>

My dear I wish I could hold you<br>

Safe in my arms from here to Eternity<br>

Alone I know you'll be waiting<br>

Where the moonbeams lean down to kiss me<br>

Where was I when the rockets came to life<br>

And carried you away into the alligator sky<br>

Even though I'll never know what's up ahead<br>

I'm never letting go<br>

I'm never letting go<br><br>

I'm a hundred thousand feet up<br>

Galaxies above me<br>

Addicted to the sky<br>

Me and gravity be grudging<br>

Cause gravity is nothing<br>

And as I'm travelling through time, <br>

I take my time for this discussion <br>

Don't get distracted if things happen to get ugly<br>

That just means things have to be adjusted <br>

And when you understand, actually it's lovely<br>

The sea is my champagne, so I tap into that bubbly<br>

Trust me, don't let them intimidate you, really they just bluffing <br>

Bad news, there is never interruption<br>

But they miscalculated how we will erupt for the eruption<br>

Light up the Richter scale all across the board<br>

Make us play something lovely<br>

Like we're conducted to find it reconstruction<br>

So welcome to The Outer Limits, homie<br>

You have been inducted, I mean abducted<br><br>

I'm never letting go<br><br>

Rollercoaster through the atmosphere<br>

I'm drowning in this starry serenade<br>

Where ecstasy becomes cavalier<br>

My imagination's taking me away<br>

Reverie whispered in my ear<br>

I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid<br>

Rollercoaster through the atmosphere<br>

My imagination's taking me away<br><br>

Yeah, well this is how I groove when I jam<br>

Welcome to my world, It's a psychedelic trance<br>

The moon and the stars are a band, so<br>

Pull out the seat and watch the constellations dance <br>

This probably wasn't in your plans<br>

You woke up on Jupiter but fell asleep in France <br>

The world is normal at glance<br>

But you probably wouldn't notice till I land<br><br>

Where was I when the rockets came to life<br>

<b>The First Noel (by TobyMac featuring Owl City)<br><br></b>

Born is the King, born is the King<br><br>

The first Noel, the angels did say<br>

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay <br>

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep<br>

On a cold winter's night that was so deep<br><br>

Born is the King, born is the King<br><br>

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>

Born is the King of Israel<br>

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>

Born is the King of Israel<br><br>

They looked up and saw a star<br>

Shining in the East beyond them far<br>

And to the Earth it gave great light<br>

And so it continued both day and night<br><br>

Born is the King, born is the King<br><br>

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>

Born is the King of Israel<br>

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>

Born is the King of Israel<br><br>

The love You shared, even scared<br>

Oh, the shepherds they were so afraid<br>

You flipped it all on that very first Christmas day<br>

So I'ma yell Noel on the streets like a newsy<br>

And sing Emmanuel 'til this Earth gotta lose me<br><br>

Born is the King, born is the King<br><br>

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel<br>

Born is the King of Israel<br>

Got the day planned and presents to wrap<br>

Fight the windchill with all of my friends<br>

And there's a man outside with a bucket and a bell<br>

Wants to go home with a story to tell<br>

And he's reminding us<br>

That his Christmas got nothing to do<br>

With living for himself, it's the...<br><br>

Would he still go huff and puff<br>
or would he bring those pigs cool stuff<br>
to decorate the deck he helped them build?<br>
Would they not get killed?<br>

Wonder if I gave an Oreo to a vampire in a creepy show,<br>
would he not act so undead?<br>
Would he thirst for milk instead?<br>

'Cause cream does wondrous things inside a chocolate sandwich dream.<br>

<b>The Christmas Song</b>
<br><br>
It's Christmas and we walk alone<br>
Two strangers with no one to miss us<br>
On our own, out in the cold<br>
<br>
Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm<br>
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm<br>
<br>
I don't have anyone at home to talk to<br>
And you don't have anything to do<br>
So I'll spend my Christmas with you<br>
<br>
I'll spend my Christmas with you<br>
<br>
It's Christmas and we are in love<br>
With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us<br>
From far above the blustery breeze<br>
<br>
Trudging onward, braving a harsh winter storm<br>
You and I met passing by, and now our spirits feel warm<br>
<br>
I believe that Jesus is truly the only way<br>
And I celebrate Christmas because it's his birthday<br>
(it's his birthday)<br>
<br>
I don't have anyone at home to talk to<br>
And you don't have anything to do<br>
So I'll spend my Christmas with you<br>
<br>
I'll spend my Christmas with you<br>
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)<br>
I'll spend my Christmas with you (ooh, ooh...)<br>

<b>Cactus In The Valley (Acoustic) (by Lights)</b><br><br>	
I never meant to wither<br>
I wanted to be tall<br>
Like a fool, left the river<br>
And watched my branches fall<br>
Old and thirsty, I longed for the flood to come back around<br>
To the cactus in the valley, that's about to crumble down<br>
<br>
And wipe the mark of sadness from my face<br>
Show me that your love will never change<br>
If my yesterday is a disgrace<br>
Tell me that you still recall my name<br>
<br>
So, the storm finally found me<br>
And left me in the dark<br>
In the cloud around me<br>
I don't know where you are<br>
If this whole world goes up in arms, all I can do is stand<br>
And I won't fight for anyone<br>
Until you move my hand<br>
<br>
And wipe the mark of madness from my face<br>
Show me that your love will never change<br>
If my yesterday is a disgrace<br>
Tell me that you still recall my name<br>
<br>
Oh, here<br>
In the shadows<br>
Here I am<br>
And I need someone by my side<br>
It becomes so<br>
Hard to stand<br>
And I keep trying to dry my eyes<br>
Come and find me<br>
In the valley<br>
<br>
And wipe the mark of sadness from my face<br>
Show me that your love will never change<br>
If my yesterday is a disgrace<br>
Tell me that you still recall my name<br>
And wipe the mark of madness from my face<br>
Show me that your love will never change<br>
If my yesterday is a disgrace<br>

<b>1. Captains of the Sky<br></b><br>

Mid-air, <br>

I woke up beneath the flight deck<br>

On a wallpaper airplane<br>

As you stared, <br>

I strapped my helmet on<br>

And left your driveway behind<br><br>

Flutter all through the night<br>

And we can pull the clouds around <br>

This paper hanger sky-light<br>

Summer smile again, <br>

And you can disappear<br>

But I'd rather be here<br><br>

Dive bomb, <br>

We descended down the staircase<br>

And crashed to the kitchen floor<br>

So long, <br>

Our flight of dowdy dreams<br>

Preened our soft-paper wings<br><br>

Flutter all through the night<br>

And we can pull the clouds around <br>

This paper hanger sky-light<br>

Summer smile again, and you can disappear<br>

But I'd rather be here<br><br>

Hello down there, <br>

The mooring made us sailorss in the air<br>

Keeping the midnight stars held high<br>

We are captains of the sky<br>

Waving goodbye<br><br>

There's a handwritten note <br>

Pressed in the door <br>

Of her screened in porch <br>

And I am sailing away <br>

Recalling that day <br>

Miles from shore<br>

She was still wearing white <br>

And Robin's egg blue, <br>

Her grandmother's dress<br>

When I left early this year, <br>

How I wound up here <br>

Is anyone's guess<br><br>

When the new sites grow old <br>

And I start to feel cold <br>

I'll sail home again<br><br>

Goodbye Brielle<br>

Only whispers can tell<br>

Of the sweet dreams that we knew so well<br>

I'll see you around <br>

Our dear ocean town<br>

The frozen days we set ablaze<br>

Sent me drifting away<br>

Like a butterfly, you floated by <br>

And now you're alone<br>

I wish I knew when<br>

I'll be back again<br>

So until then I wish you well<br>

My dear Brielle<br><br>

Strolling over the sand, <br>

In cobblestone paths <br>

That wind through the trees <br>

Breathing the sweet forest air <br>

Makes a bluebird aware <br>

That she could be free<br><br>

When the new sites grow old <br>

And I start to feel cold <br>

I'll sail home again<br><br>

Goodbye Brielle<br>

Only whispers can tell<br>

Of the sweet dreams that we knew so well<br>

I'll see you around <br>

And now you're alone<br>

Farewell nightmares I am free<br>

Welcome streams of sweet dreams<br>

What lies out there?<br>

No one knows<br>

The tide could bring in anything<br>

So steady as she goes<br>

Steady as she goes<br><br>

I can feel her<br>

As I lie awake<br>

But she's back home<br>

Still waiting alone<br>

When morning breaks<br>

Post war novels<br>

Keep us alive<br>

And I know she'll be dying to see me<br>

When I arrive<br><br>

Hey dear sister<br>

How are you<br>

I've long to see you ever since you <br>

Made your stage debut<br>

We always knew you would be<br>

The most angelic actress this dramatic world would see <br>

And the critics do agree<br><br>

Several state lines<br>

Keep us apart<br>

And don't lose sleep<br>

Cause I'll always keep you in my heart<br><br>

Crashing white caps<br>

Keep us alive<br>

And she knows I'll be dying to see her <br>

The next time I arrive<br><br>

What lies out there?<br>

<b>4. Explorers<br><br></b>

This old mountain side<br>

Where we used to reside<br>

Is slowly recalling<br>

The things we discovered inside<br>

Oh the crystal caves<br><br>

We shed both our jackets<br>

And I hammered brackets<br>

From old metal chairs<br>

To the walls, a crude set of stairs<br><br>

To lead us down<br><br>

And you tied a rope<br>

To the steepening slope<br>

A jerry rigged harness<br>

So we could descend in the dark<br><br>

But the tide came in<br><br>

And we found ourselves in the sea<br>

Deep under water<br>

We both found that we could still breathe<br>

So we spent the day submerged<br>

And we swam the evening away<br><br>

The water was clear<br>

Like the pure atmosphere<br>

As we kicked and fluttered<br>

Through caverns all cluttered with age<br><br>

In the afterglow<br><br>

We swim hand and hand<br>

Over white satin sand<br>

And you left a ribbon<br>

To honor the pale gibbon moon<br><br>

But that was years ago<br><br>

And we never came up for air<br>

Down there<br>

We can go anywhere<br><br>

The old world was dying<br>

While we took our flying<br>

Like peregrine falcons<br>

Beneath the transparent blue waves<br><br>

Far below the surf<br><br>

And we spent the hours<br>

With submarine flowers<br>

I knew I'd remember<br>

That day in November<br><br>

As we<br><br>

Felt alive again<br>

Cause we found ourselves in the sea<br>

Deep underwater<br>

We both found that we could still breathe<br>

So we spent the day submerged<br>

And we swam the evening away<br><br>

Like you are center-stage on Broadway<br>

Cause when you're on your own<br>

And weld the cable car<br>

And I'll drive down<br>

Wound up in Prince Edward Island<br>

And my head<br>

Feels like it's ready to blow.<br>

I served and scratched a rainbow<br>

So curved<br>

I felt the pain go<br>

Through my joints<br>

And now I don't want to play.<br>

Swinging down<br>

Downtown at seven thirty,<br>

Dreams never die when we sleep<br>

Beneath the open sky in the deep<br>

Shades over head of blue and red<br>

I searched beyond the clouds, <br>

Are you there?<br>

And I walked sadly onward to the crowds, <br>

I saw beyond the pier <br>

To right where you were<br>

But I beheld a sight so pure<br><br>

Why do I hate the dark when I'm alone?<br>

I was on my way to a brighter day, <br>

I'm still chasing around <br>

But somehow I believe that this is home <br>

That my discomposure left me forever<br>

So take me away<br><br>

So I suggested we'd grow up fast <br>

And not be the last <br>

And look where we are<br>

Pays me a visit and<br>

Drags my eyelids down.<br><br>

And I'll be your escort in a sad waltz around the room <br>
I'll twirl you all around without a sound<br>
<br>
The snowfall, the great lakes know it best<br>

When the summers travel west and disappear<br>

Like dry ice, the snowcaps on the hills<br>

Melt like 50 dollar bills of our new year<br>

Oh we are cold<br>
 <br>

I'll be the flowers of the field that slowly bloom<br> 
While you are soundly sleeping on the ground<br>
And I'll be your escort in a sad waltz around the room<br> 
I'll twirl you all around without a sound<br><br>

We're trying hard to alleviate this dizzy feeling<br>

We're skipping meals because it feels that bad<br>

If we survive we'll stay alive below the ceiling<br>

Of new atmospheres and brighter years that we'll have.<br>
