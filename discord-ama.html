<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 1 [from SkyWind]</b></summary>
Paper Tigers and Beautiful Mystery are well loved songs that went unofficially released. What is your criteria for deciding what gets officially released, and do you plan to revisit older demos like you did for Car Troubles?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 1</b></summary>
My criteria is... that I don't have a criteria. And that's because my process is very... subjective you might say. I'm always working on something, I'm always working on random bits of music: demos, rough concepts. Just jumbled up wild incoherent lyrics, but as I work on these ideas some of em just start to take shape and just feel like finished songs.<br>

<br>
I'm not sure why that is or how that happens, but what I do know is that it's not a concious decision. It's just more of a feeling, it's more of a sense of excitement that pulls me along to finish certain songs and not others.<br>
<br>
I just find myself opening those sessions for those songs more often on my computer and they get finished and that excitement is what tells me okay this one's gonna go on the album or this one's gonna be released quote unquote "officially".<br>
<br>
So for Paper Tigers and Beautiful Mystery I wrote those, I really liked em but I didn't know what to do with them, it's hard to describe. I just thought to myself, "okay these are cool, but where do they fit, where do they go, where do they fit?" I never could find the answer to that question, I could never figure that out so I just, ha, posted em online and I kinda forgot about em to be honest. <br>
<br>
But it's amazing to know that people discovered those songs, they heard those, they enjoyed them and they're still asking me about those years later, those 2 songs years and years later. That's so cool for me, that truly is mind boggling - I love it!<br>
<br>
Car Trouble has its own kinda interesting story as well. So back in 2008 I was asked to write a 30 second jingle for a car commercial but the company didn't end up using what I pitched to them, this 30 second demo. I didn't know what to do with it, I tried to finish it, I tried to finish it really hard and it just wasn't working so I just saved it and years later I posted it online as a demo just thinking "ya know, maybe somebody will find this this interesting?"<br>
<br>
Over the years, again just like the other two, so many people have asked me about that demo and it was really surprising ya know! <br>
<br>
So then in 2024 I was going through old ideas that I'd written from years prior and thought "oh, I know how to finish this song!" like it all made sense to me, all of a sudden. All those years before that I could not for the life of me figure out how to finish that song, but it happened kind of in that moment and that's - I guess that's part of the fun, ya know sometimes songs just sit there unfinished for ages. What, 17 years in this case, until the right moment... crazy!<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 2 [from pepper11114]</b></summary>
A while ago you said that a new Sky Sailing album was in the works - Is that still true? 
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 2</b></summary>
Okay, techinically... yes, technically yes, it's something I really want to do, I have ideas for it but alas the plan is dormant right now so it's not active. And that's because life is demanding, life is full of demands, I'm sure you can probably relate and with the amount of things going on in my life, the sheer amount of things that are happening all the time I just haven't been able to get to another Sky Sailing album as of yet. But... it's not off the table, it's just a matter of when.<br>
<br>
The same goes for my orchestral music under Adam Young and I actually have quite the list of other creative aspirations that I wanna tackle in this same category if and when I get the time, so I wanna record a punk hardcore album for example, I wanna make trance music, I wanna make ambient music, I wanna write hymns, I wanna score films and video games, I wanna do production for other bands, mixing for other bands, there's all kinds of things I wanna do, but for now Owl City is my priority and Sky Sailing remains on the list though, a 100%.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 3 [from just.t.soup (Boston)]</b></summary>
Are there any subtle details or hidden messages in your songs that listeners rarely pick up on but are meaningful to you?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 3</b></summary>
Absolutely. I love recording my own sounds. So field recordings, foley sounds, objects from everyday life, literally anything around you at all times you can use to make a sound. If it can be, you know, tapped or struck, or if it switches on or off, whatever it is it can make a sound. <br>
<br>
I record stuff like that and then I cut those sounds up into usually tiny layers, short samples, so drum samples usually is how they end up, and then I use those in my songs. I might zoom way way in on a sound, clip a tiny portion of the waveform out, and then loop that over and over so it makes a tone or a pitch, and then that becomes a playable synth patch just like any other synthesizer patch.<br>
<br>
And so, and that’s really cool to me, it's just, it's all totally unnecessary for anyone else to know or to understand that this is what you’re hearing, but for me it’s like, it's like keeping a scrapbook or a journal, you know, but with audio and it makes it really meaningful to me.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 4 [from peasantariel (Ariel)]</b></summary>
What was your favorite moment from the To The Moon Tour?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 4</b></summary>
Okay. I was invited to play at Seaworld in Florida, in Orlando, never been there before, always wanted to go, and the stage there is amazing. Big stadium style seating, overlooking a beautiful ocean-like water scene that stretches way out in the background, and it felt like the stage is, is floating out in the water from where you’re sitting in the crowd. And there was a part of this show near the end of the night where I was up there just shredding on the keytar, just over-the-top totally gratuitous gnarly synth solo.<br>
<br>
And the Seaworld staff had given my lighting guy, the guy who travels with us to run the lights, control of these massive, lighted water fountains in the park. These are built-in, out in the water, out beyond the stage, and they can shoot water through the air in these amazing displays of colors and they can do all kinds of things. And my lighting guy had his finger on the button and he saved those fountains until the end of the show during this moment, during this synth solo. <br>
<br>
So I just had this surreal internal moment, private moment with myself, standing on top of my piano in front of a huge crowd playing a solo on a keytar at Seaworld. I’m outside, it’s 9:00 pm on a beautiful spring night in Florida, the wind is whipping through my hair, you know, the stage lights are going crazy, people are going crazy, screaming, having the time of their lives (hopefully). I’m certainly having the time of my life.<br>
<br>
The fountains in the background are shooting water in all sorts of colors and designs through the air. There’s roller coasters whizzing by the stage going around the park, part of Seaworld there, and okay, so then get this Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral are off to the East of us, we’re in Orlando, and a literal rocket launches from one of these places in the background behind the stage right at this moment during all of this, during the keytar shredding. Not even kidding, it was so surreal.<br>
<br>
The only thing that we were missing were fireworks, we could have used some fireworks you know, why not, might as well. And probably like two or three dolphins you know doing backflips in the background. That would have been just the extra icing on the cake. It was... magical. Unforgettable.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 5 [from mystman12]</b></summary>
Have you ever considered scoring video games? You created singles for some games in the past, but if you made an OST what kind of game would you be most excited to create one for?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 5</b></summary>
Okay if I’m allowed to aim high here, I would choose to score a Breath Of The Wild or a Red Dead Redemption 2 kind of game. I mean, those games are insanely good so I’m gonna aim high. So open world, sandbox type game, action/adventure, cinematic, heavy on the storytelling, that sort of vein. I really like fictionalized versions of history, of the past. I think Red Dead is what, late 19th century on the American frontier? That’s one of my favorite eras in history to read about and to imagine so, yeah. Something along those lines. <br>
<br>
If anybody is familiar with the book Airborn by Kenneth Oppel, a universe like that. <br>
A fictionalized, Jules Verne, steampunk, Victorian, fantasy world. If that was the setting of some kind of open world adventure game and I could score that, I mean, I couldn’t ask for anything more than that.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 6 [from alien.rosey (Rosey)]</b></summary>
"What is the latest book you've read? I'm an avid reader and I'd love to check out anything you'd recommend :)"
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 6</b></summary>
So that would be Monster by Frank Peretti. I’d read it before it's one of my favorites, so I recently reread it and, yeah, it's so good, so good. It’s a thriller, so we got mysterious creatures, sinister forces, really bad things that happen when people try to play God, and it’s a page-turner, it’s really hard to put down. The audiobook is great too, so highly recommend.<br>
<br>
The book I’m in the middle of right now is called Gospel Fluency by Jeff Vanderstelt. Amazing book about identifying the fruit in your life, good or bad, and bringing that into alignment with the truth about Jesus. Who he is and what that means for you. This is one way we become quote-on-quote "fluent in the gospel", says the author of the book. It’s been a life changing read for me so, another recommendation there.<br>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 7 [from littleorangedog]</b></summary>
My question to Adam is as a musician who likes to craft stories, characters and worlds through your lyrics and music, would you ever consider writing a book? You have mentioned your love for books like Watership Down and The Lord of the Rings before, but have you ever thought about writing your own piece of fiction?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 7</b></summary>
Yes! I’ve thought about it, I’ve thought about it a lot over the years. I’m also an avid reader and I would love to write a novel someday, at some point. I have no idea how that would fit in, how that would work. I’m not sure what genre it would be, probably some blend of historical fiction, you know, and adventure and fantasy, so similar to what I would score if I could pick any video game I guess, yeah.<br>
<br>
I love anthropomorphic stories, so where animals have human traits, I really like those. So I would bet there’d be talking animals involved, there better be, I guess. But yeah, for now music is what I’m supposed to be doing but, who knows, maybe someday I’ll write a book.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 8 [from kevowo (Kevin)]</b></summary>
What inspires you to still create? As you enter the 18th year of Owl City, what inspires you to still create music and tour?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 8</b></summary>
Wow, 18 years. It doesn't feel that long by any stretch. You know I'm not sure. I'm not sure what inspires me if I'm honest. I just... all I know is that it comes from being in alignment with God's plan for me. I don't know how to describe where it comes from beyond that. <br>
<br>
What I do know is that I don't want to be inspired by external motivators that don't lead anywhere. So like, I don't want to be inspired to create in terms of following the money, following the fame, trying to get fame, money, trying to get followers. I don't want the attention to be honest, I don't want to play the corporate business, like, music industry game. <br>
<br>
I've, I've kinda been there a little bit, I don't want to become a slave to achieving success. I think sometimes success can make you feel like you're a slave to it and as though you have to defend some kind of title after you've gained success, that can happen. <br>
And yeah, I don't want to chase algorithms or awards, or any kind of accolades.<br>
<br>
I just want to make music and follow the path that God has laid out for me. I just want to stay on that path and not wander from it. That's my goal, I'm not perfect at it but whenever I doubt myself I feel God gently reminding me, "Hey Adam, you're not responsible for everything that happens in this world, as it turns out. You're not supposed to be all things to all people, I'm not calling you to ride any other roller coaster than the one that I've got for you, than the one that you're on. By the way, I'm with you." These are all things I feel reminded of whenever I doubt myself. He reminds me to just do your own thing, just make music, that's what I called you to do. Just make music. And that's enough for me.<br>

<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 9 [from owl1]</b></summary>
Do you wear wigs? Have you worn wigs? Will you wear wigs? When will you wear wigs? 
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 9</b></summary>
So if you don't know, this is a reference to a hidden easter egg in The Lord of the Rings DVDs, the Peter Jackson films, where Dominic Monaghan who plays Merry pranks Elijah Wood. It's classic! If you haven't seen it I'm sure it's on YouTube. That's a good one.<br>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 10 [from bagelgabe (Gabe)]</b></summary>
Hey Adam! How long did it take you to make Coco Moon, from the very first song you started writing for it, to the final touches you added to the production of the last song before sending the album off to get released. I’ve always been interested in the artistic processes of musicians, and would love to know yours regarding this album! Also, do you remember what the first and last song you completed for it was? 
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 10</b></summary>
Yeah, again my process is... it's weird, it's a little weird, it's a little scrambled, it's a little half-hazard, you could say nonlinear, kind of all over the place which means a lot of my writing for certain albums overlaps with other albums.<br>
<br>
So I think for example the first song I wrote for Coco Moon was "Adam, Check Please." And I wrote it back in, I wanna say 2017 which was before Cinematic came out, the last album before Coco Moon, Cinematic, that was 2018. And I think the last song I wrote for Coco Moon was "My Muse" in 2023. <br>
<br>
So I didn't work on Coco Moon exclusively of course for all those years, what is that... seven years. I guess from beginning to end, I would say I worked solely on Coco Moon for about a year. A year and a half kinda with no other focus, but yeah, it's all pretty blurry in my mind.<br>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Question 11 [from geds4]</b></summary>
What are some of your favorite Bible verses and why?
</details>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>Answer to question 11</b></summary>
Okay, I've got a lot of em, but I'll give you three:<br>
<br>
One of my favorite is actually John 3:17, so one verse after probably the most well-known verse in the Bible. Verse 17 says: "For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him." <br>
<br>
I wonder if a lot of people internalize God the Father as a cosmic like policeman, who's sitting up there, happily, maybe happily waiting just to punish you. You know, happily waiting for you to do something wrong, he's ready to catch you red-handed and he's eager serve justice. I wonder if a lot of people think that or internalize God the Father this way.<br>
<br>
When in reality, the Bible says the opposite. It says that He, in fact loves us, each of us deeply, no matter what we’ve done. And to show that (that's what he thinks), He sent His Son to Earth as a human being, as a man, not to hunt us down and deliver our guilty verdicts to us and point out "Oh, woah all you guys ever do is rebel, and sin, and mess it all up! And you say won’t do it again, and you totally do." Obviously he didn't do that.<br>
<br>
The reason He came to Earth was to die for us, to save us, to rescue us, to set us free, to pay our debts for us. And that’s all... that's only part of it. He died for our sins. Why? To give us life, so that we may live, so that we may live with God in heaven where he is, forever. And all of that happens through Jesus. That's the only way. He is the only way that that happens, and He offers it to us you know: salvation, rescue, freedom, full pardon, all wrongs erased. That’s all through Jesus, through Himself.<br>
<br>
And we don’t earn that. None of that happens by our own performance or how good we are. None of that earns us God’s mercy. He gives it freely to us because He loves us. So when we repent and we follow Jesus, who is the Son of God, we are rescued and we are given life. Yeah. He came not to condemn the world but to save it and that took me years, honestly, to internalize what that really means.<br>
<br>
Next verse, Philippians 4:6-7: "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid-the Bible is, of course, replete with that phrase, that command: "Don’t be afraid, do not be afraid." It’s all over the place. The way the Holy Spirit speaks to me through this particular verse is usually tied to whatever hardship in life that I’m dealing with, whatever kind of suffering that I’m going through.<br>
<br>
This verse just seems to hit the spot. I think that the "do not be anxious" command implies that no matter the hardship that you’re facing, trust Him. Choose to put your trust in God, even though you’re afraid and you can’t, for the life of you, see how whatever horrible thing you’re going through is going to work out. Trust Him.<br>
<br>
I think we often don’t even realize that we are trusting in our own merit, our own abilities, our own reasoning, our own strength, our own understanding of things. There's a verse that addresses that: "Lean not on your own understanding." <br>
<br>
And I think a common result of doing all this is fear. I think inevitable: fear. We're trusting in an ilusion, which is we can control everything. Well maybe not that we can control everything, but maybe that, the ilusion is that we aren't in control but we believe that we should be in control. Maybe that's more common, I don't know.<br>
<br>
And yeah, the fear comes just in all shades: anxiety. But for me, this verse is medicine for that. It’s salve on the wound. "Don’t be anxious" almost by default, from my shoes, I subconsciously assume that I have all the information from my perspective. <br>
<br>
Of course I don’t. Of course I don't have all the information. I can't, because I'm not God. I didn’t create the universe and everything in it, therefore my perspective is limited, extremely limited.<br>
<br>
And I forget that constantly. I can see the tiniest sliver of the big picture, and that’s all. But if I trust in the Lord and surrender to Him daily, He gives me peace, that’s His promise. If I demand that my suffering make sense to me, that’s just gonna grow anxiety fruit.<br>
<br>
And I don’t want that. I want the opposite. I want fruits of the Spirit. I want the opposite of fear and anxiety. What’s amazing is that we can know what the fruits of the Spirit are because the Bible tells us what they are: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.<br>
<br>
So, I try to remind myself of this every day: remember, Adam, God sees what’s going on. It makes sense to Him, and therefore, even though I am incapable of understanding the big picture, it all makes sense to God. He knows. And because He knows, I can trust Him. I can rest in trusting in Him and feel peace as a result. And so can you. I find a lot of comfort in that verse.<br>
<br>
Last one, okay, 2 Corinthians 12:9 "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me."<br>
<br>
This has been massive for me in the last couple of years, and it walks closely hand in hand with the last verse about not being anxious. <br>
<br>
I’m the type of person who likes to understand things. I’m interested in how things work; I like to figure things out, I like to solve problems, and I like to fix things. But of course, there’s so much in life that I cannot fix. I can’t even come close to. There’s so much I don’t have control over, and letting go of that desire for control is the journey, one of the ways God continually refines me, continually grows me, strengthens my faith in Him.<br>
<br>
I think he's by graciously allowing me over and over to try to solve these unfixable problems. And when I realize that I can’t, He gives me great peace when I surrender to Him and go, "Okay, I can’t fix this. I can’t do anything here, and actually, whatever it is I think I need, I actually don’t." You know, we all suffer.<br>
<br>
One of the things that struck me years ago is that it’s not a matter of if you’re going to suffer, and it's when you’re going to suffer. And however bad it is, this verse speaks to me and reminds me that all I really need is Jesus. He is enough.<br>
<br>
Even though I suffer, the Lord says, "It’s okay, I know, but I am all you need." He is sufficient. And even though I still really want to fix it, it’s true-God’s grace is sufficient. I think I’m in control half the time, but of course, I’m not. I’m very, very weak, but I can actually brag about that weakness, which is crazy. Because Jesus’s power can use that weakness for His glory.<br>
<br>
Even though I can’t see the upside to it and just want to solve the problem, that's the truth, that Jesus can use what seems to me just like this horrible weakness for His glory. If I could solve all my own problems, then who would really be God between the two of us? How much would I actually need a Savior if I could solve all of life’s problems?<br>
<br>
When the truth is, if I know anything about anything, I know that I need a Savior, and that is Jesus. There’s no other way. It’s Jesus. And Jesus, by His grace, that's what allows this to happen. By His grace, every cell in my body relies on. Every breath I take is all grace, and I forget that constantly. And I forget that His grace is inexhaustible, which is the best news you can imagine. He is all I need. He is enough. That's this verse, such a good verse. That one's really given me a lot of hope in the last few years so.<br>
<br>
But yeah, that's it for now. Thanks again for your questions, you guys. I know I didn't get to all of em today, but I read them all, and they, they just brightened my day. Thanks so much. See ya.<br>
